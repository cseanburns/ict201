# IS/ICT 201: Personal Knowledge Management

# Funding & Health Sources

## Slide 1: Title page

Welcome to the discussion on health sources of information.

## Slide 2: Health information sources

Health information sources---the Miracle Cure---what do you believe on the 
internet? Do you believe anything? Or are you critical of what you read? Let's 
proceed.

## Slide 3: MedlinePlus 

I'll create a demonstration video of PubMed, the main National of Library
Medicine Website and database, but in this lecture, I'll talk about
[MedlinePlus][1], which is the general public interface to PubMed's more research
oriented audience.

MedlinePlus offers information catered to the general public. It's also
provided by the [US National Library of Medicine][2] and the [National
Institutes of Health][3]. You will find the information on this site more
accessible than what's on PubMed. You can see on the screen in this image four
main parts of the site:

* Health Topics
* Drugs and Supplements
* Videos and Cool Tools
* Lab Test Information
* Medical Encyclopedia

## Slide 4: MedlinePlus

If I click on the *Health Topics* link, I'll access detailed, public friendly 
information on a variety of topics that are categorized into five different 
groups:

* Body Location/Systems
* Disorders and Conditions
* Diagnosis and Therapy
* Demographic Groups
* Health and Wellness

I may follow any of these links to more detailed pages on the various aspects 
of these categories. E.g., if I click on the *Blood, Heart and Circulation* 
link, I can access more detailed information on topics under this category.

## Slide 5: MedlinePlus

MedlinePlus' *Drugs & Supplements* page provides detailed information on
OTC and prescription drugs as well as information on herbal and other types
of supplements. Drilling down into this site provides a wealth of information 
and provides answers to important questions about the various drugs, herbs, and 
supplements out there. The next slide highlights this for the page on 
*aspirin*.

## Slide 7: MedlinePlus

The *Videos and Tools* section of the sites provides information in other
accessible ways. For example, here's a cool video on *macular degeneration*.
Such things are great for simple educational use but are also helpful if you
have or know someone who has issues with topics presented in these videos.

## Slide 8: MedlinePlus

There are some other neat tools and games to explore on this site. The Health 
Check Tools link will take you to a page that has quizzes and games. E.g., do 
you need a hearing or an asthma test? There are quizzes for that. And there are 
links to games to help people identify parts of the anatomy, learn about blood 
types, and more. Many of these games are aimed at children, and thus are also 
good educational resources. Also, some or most of the games may require Flash
to play, and this is less supported by browsers today.

## Slide 9: MedlinePlus

There is a nice transcript on evaluating health information on websites. I'll
provide a demo that shows how to use the checklist in a following video. But
read through this transcript -- part of your work this week will involve using
the questions posed here to evaluate a medical/health care website.

## Slide 10: Funding

This week you'll use the Charity Navigator (see chapter 5 of your textbook) to 
see what kind of information you can find about a charity. In addition to the 
health info evaluation, I'll also provide a series of demos of funding sites, 
statistical information sites, and like. Stay tuned.

## Slide 11: Conclusion

In conclusion:

* MedlinePlus provides comprehensive health and medical information for the
  general public.
