# IS/ICT 201: Personal Knowledge Management

# Curating Sources

## Introduction

Hi Class, welcome to the week where we begin to discuss tools that you can use 
to curate information sources. Please remember that this is a short 
module---only two weeks long---and thus all work for this module is due by the 
end of the upcoming assignment.

In the previous forum we examined tools to manage academic sources of 
information. Some of the tools you'll look at this week can be used for those 
kinds of sources too, but what I want us to do this week is think more broadly 
about the kinds of information that we need, use, or like and that we may want 
to hold onto and the kinds of tools that will help us curate such sources. 
Generally the same issues hold true here as they do for managing academic 
sources, but it's also true that different tools afford us different 
capabilities, and that today, managing academic and non-academic sources has 
become more social.

This week we're reading a short and simple article that lists and describes a
bunch of different platforms that are available for us to use to manage the
sources we collect.

Valenza, J. K., Boyer, B. L., & Curis, D. (2014). Curation platforms: 
*Library Technology Reports, 50*(7), 60-65. 
https://journals.ala.org/index.php/ltr/article/view/4792/5739

Astute observers will note that the term *curation* is used in that article and
in the title of this week's discussion forum and lecture. That begs the
question: what do we mean by curation? Well, it's a term we use to signify the
caring for something or someone. Thus someone who actively and intentionally
curates sources of information is a person who is engaged with the tools and
the sources to do that best. By implication, this means not simply adding
sources to a personal library and then forgetting about them, but paying
attention to them, updating them, and removing them, if necessary. It's a
continual process---akin to gardening or other activities that require an
attending to.

## Managing the Information Glut

Just like scholarly or academic information, there's also all kinds of 
regular or niche information. Each of you already know that because you 
experience it just about every day. That is, aside from being students and 
having to manage academic or related information, it's certainly true that we 
also interact with information related to personal health, various kinds of 
logistics that come with being a 21st person in a particular place, with 
hobbies and interests, shopping, personal records, business pursuits, things 
about friends, and so forth.

In our analog days, managing information of any kind may have meant putting
documents in manila folders and placing those folders in folder cabinets. Or it
meant putting photographs in physical binders that we'd call photo albums. This
kind of behavior has informed how we we practice this now but it was much more
restrained because it was far more costly and time intensive. Even so, though
we may now use fewer beige folders for our physical papers, receipts, and other
documents, and fewer binders for our printed photographs, we still create
digital albums and digital folders to house all this stuff, and we do it just
as a matter of course, that is, less intentionally, or it's done for us,
algorithmically, by some product like Google Photos or Facebook Photos.

Another big difference between then and now is that things have gotten much 
more social. When the social web was born, a number of tools arose that 
helped us not only manage how we collect and store information, but also 
allowed us to share it in newer ways and with more people, as well as create 
new content via engagement with those people. As a result, almost every tool 
that helps us manage information and sources of information has some kind of 
social component to it. The funny thing about this is that, in those analog 
days, there was a running joke about forcing friends and family to sit through 
photo slides or home movies, but now whole industries exist around sharing our 
photos and videos just because of that social aspect of the web.

## Social Collecting on the Web

Many websites offer ways to collect and save information. At its most basic, 
there's the simple ability to star, like, favorite, heart, thumbs up, etc 
some thing that somebody has shared. E.g., Twitter has a heart button, and if 
you so-call *heart* a tweet, you end up saving it to a list of other tweets 
you've *hearted*. Consider also YouTube. If you give a video a thumbs up, 
then you've added that video to a list of others that you've liked. As such, 
this hearting or liking serves two main functions:

1. A *communicative function*: e.g., when you click on that heart, you notify
   a person that you like their tweet;
2. A *collecting function*: e.g., when you click on that heart, you save
   that tweet in a collection of other favorite tweets, which you can revisit 
   and browse later.

Thus, sometimes favoriting/hearting serves to acknowledge a response to
someone, but it also functions as a kind of bookmark. This dual activity is
common across many social bookmarking sites, too, such as Pinterest.

## Digital Curation 

Curating and managing general information may or may not have a social
component. Even without social, there is a whole area of work called digital
curation. People who work in this area are responsible for working with a broad
range of non-personal information, such as institutional documents, corporate
documents, government documents, research data, and so forth. But when I talk
about curating information, I'm talking about how you personally curate your
own information that you save and you use. Just like there are well-tended
garden managed by professional gardeners, there are also personal gardens
managed by you. These are different areas, but we can definitely borrow from
the ideas, best practices, and tools that professional digital curators use in
their jobs.

Like professional digital curators, when we focus on curating our own
information, we're focused on managing digital objects, evaluating them
periodically, preserving them, if possible, for future use, organizing them,
and ensuring we have access to them. For now, let's focus on two aspects of
personal digital curation: organizing information and accessing that
information.

## Organizing Information

Collecting information and sources on the web doesn't serve much of a 
purpose if we don't have a system to organize the information. Tags help
serve this purpose.

Tagging can be a powerful tool, especially when it's social. Each of you
already know what a tag is---you use or have seen tags on sites like Twitter,
where they're called *hashtags* or on sites like Instagram. Tags enable us to
describe sources or things and share them or retrieve them later from our own
personal stores or from others. This is because not only do tags say something
*about* the thing we're tagging, but they are often hyperlinked to things, and
clicking on them will retrieve those things.

Since we're talking about non-academic information, I'll show you an example
from my own [Google Keep](https://keep.google.com) account. Each one of the
tags you see here in the right side image serves as a link. Clicking on one of
those tags would retrieve all sources that I've saved that were in my Keep
library or database and that share that tag.

So, as an illustration, if I click on the *Linux* tag that you see in this
image, I'll retrieve all the other Keep notes that are tagged with Linux. 

## Accessing Information

Here's an example. I clicked on the *Linux* tag/link from the previous slide's
example, and I retrieved all the sources that I had tagged under *Linux*. This
enables me explore my own web of sources---things that are linked together
through a network of tags.

## Accessing Information

On some platforms, I can view my entire list of tags---all of the ones that
I've created and used in my entire library. The image on the right is a partial
screen shot of my tag list. If I click on any of those tags, I'll retrieve
articles and other works that share that tag.

## Technical term: folksonomy

Another way to refer to or talk about tagging is to use the term
*folksonomies*. What this term indicates is the overall structure of the tags
created by users of a system. It's the portmanteau of the words *folk* and
*taxonomy*.

Take a moment and access these slides in Google Drive and watch this short
video of this guy driving and talking about *folksonomies*. Despite the 
craziness of this, it's a good video with a nice overview of what 
folksonomies are.

## Technical term: folksonomy

Aside from what the speaker mentions, there are some disadvantages of tagging 
and with creating *folksonomies*. These are:

- polysemy: the ambiguity of an individual word or phrase that can be used (in
  different contexts) to express tow or more different meanings (ex: crane as
  in bird, crane as in construction equipment) (from WordNet).
- synonymy: sameness of meaning (from WordNet)
- plurals and parts of speech
- depth of tagging - specificity

An example of specificity, my *Linux* tag in my Keep account is rather broad,
but Linux as an operating system covers a lot of material. There are things
that I want to save to my Keep account that are about Linux, but there are also
things that I may want to integrate into my Systems Administration course,
which uses Linux as a sys admin operating system. To resolve this, I have
a more specific tag titled *SysAdmin*. 

## Technical term: folksonomy

There are other important disadvantages to keep in mind when we use tagging 
or folksonomies. These are observed when we compare folksonomies to 
traditional controlled vocabularies or terms, the kinds that you became 
familiar with when you investigated your databases in previous weeks.

Consider LCSH or the Library of Congress Subject Headings. In the image to 
the right of the screen, there are three subject headings
for this book:

- decision-making
- organizational-behavior
- social sciences

These are all subject headings and if you click on a link to one, you'll
retrieve all books in the online catalog that share that subject heading.
Note the terms after the dashes: *political aspects* after the
*decision-making* and *organizational behavior* headings and *philosophy*
after the *social sciences* heading. These are called subdivisions and
represent, in these cases, *political aspects of decision-making*,
*political-aspects of organizational behavior*, and *philosophy of social
sciences*. You can do the same kind of thing with tagging, that is, divvy up
the broader terms, but in a less controlled fashion.

## Technical term: folksonomy

*Polysemy* is when a word has more than one meaning. For example, the term 
*library* may refer to something like the thing you find when you visit WT 
Young or something like the thing you use when you write a computer program. 
*Synonymy*, or synonyms more commonly, as you know, is when two or more words 
have similar meanings. Controlled vocabularies and things like thesauri are 
created to help resolve these confusions in our language. While folksonomies 
offer a lot advantages, one's person use of *library* as a tag can't always 
be paired with another person's use of that term.

How is this resolved? Let's take a simple example of the thesaurus. Here's an 
image of a controlled term, *chewing gum*, which is a term the Library of 
Congress uses to describe works about *chewing gum*. You can see here that 
this main term has a variant, *gum, chewing*. Users who search using the 
terms *gum chewing* will be directed to works that have been assigned the 
controlled term *chewing gum*. Some controlled terms have many variants since 
there may be many ways to refer to the idea.

We also see that *chewing gum* has a broader term, *confectionary*, and a
narrower term, *bubble gum*. The connection between these three terms, and
the relation (broader than, narrower than) highlights how controlled
vocabularies are not simply lists of specified terms to describe works and
other objects, but that they are, more importantly, terms that are fixed in 
meaning, and then indexed and connected to each other in a web of other 
related terms.

So what *folksnomies* lack, *controlled subject headings* are good at. And vice
versa.

## Conclusion

In conclusion:

- Collecting information often means collecting packages that contain
  information. A journal article, an image file, a music file, and so forth,
  are all instances of information packages.
- Collecting information on the Web can be the result of the function of a
  web service (e.g., Twitter) that is used for other things (i.e., where the
  primary service is not collecting or bookmarking), or it can be the result of
  a site that is specifically used for collecting information, such as Google
  Keep, but also others that you may be more likely familiar with, such as
  Delicious and EverNote.
- Collecting information is a useless activity if we do not have some means
  to organize that information for later retrieval.
- Tags, and folksonomies, are a useful and interesting way to organize
  information.
- Since tags are uncontrolled, they do suffer from some limitations. But in
  a way:
- The advantages of controlled vocabulary are the disadvantages of
  folksonomies. And the advantages of folksonomies (such as being able to use
  my own terms) are the disadvantages of controlled vocabulary.

In these slides and in this presentation, I've discussed some of the advantages
of controlled vocabularies and compared to folksonomies. In our forum this
week, you'll discuss some of the advantages of folksonomies.
