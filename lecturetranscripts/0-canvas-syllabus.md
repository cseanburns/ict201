# Course Review and Canvas

Hi Class, welcome to the summer 2020 semester and to IS/ICT 201: Personal
Knowledge Management. My name is Dr. Sean Burns. I'm an associate professor at
the School of Information Science.

This week our job is to review the syllabus, become acquainted with the Canvas
learning management system, and also get started on the content. I'll start
this introduction by discussing the basic topics of this course and its
outline, and some of the requirements, and then I'll speak about Canvas for
a bit.

## Course Review

What is this course? What do we mean by personal knowledge management? Well,
I'd hazard a guess that most of us depend largely on two main sources to search
for, locate, and retrieve information, either on a daily basis or for more
extensive work. These two sources are the people we know and the search
engines, like Google, that we use on a daily basis. Furthermore, when we rely
on the people we know for information, it's likely that we'll ask these people
(friends, family, co-workers, professors, etc.) for information via some
technology. These technologies include the more long-standing technologies,
like email, various social media platforms, such as Facebook, Twitter, etc., as
well as more direct communication technologies, like texting and messaging. In
this course, our job is to wean ourselves off these two primary channels of
communication (search engines and people) and to expose ourselves to a wider
array of the information sources that exist on the web. This is because it's
important to understand that the people we know may not always have the best
information for us and that search engines, like Google, cannot index every web
page. Also, we need to know how to evaluate sources of information, which means
we need to know something about how these sources are described, collected,
curated, and presented to us. And we also have to know a bit about how to
manage and apply this information---that is, how to make it our own, how to
learn from what we collect and use or enjoy it for various purposes.

With that direction in mind, let's discuss Canvas and the general outline of
this course. 

When you first login to the course shell or when you click on the Home page,
you will be taken to the Modules section. This class is organized into four
thematic modules:

* Module 1: Search
* Module 2: Managing Information
* Module 3: Special Information Sources, and
* Module 4: Personalizing Information.

You will notice that all the discussions and assignments for the entire
semester are available and accessible to you now. This means that you may work
ahead, if you like. However, please note that I will not grade ahead. Thus,
let's say then that you finish the entire course by the end of June. Each
discussion board and assignment still has a due date at a specific time, and
I won't actually grade those discussion boards or assignments until after those
due dates have passed. This is important to know because I do try to provide
good feedback on your work, and if you work too far ahead, you may not benefit
from that feedback by incorporating it into future work.

Moving on---we have 15 discussion forums in this class. You'll find, as they
are released to you, discussion forums related to weekly readings in each of
these modules. Most discussion forums will include a recorded lecture, and
almost all are task driven. For each discussion forum, I will post a topic to
discuss or a task to complete. Successful completion and postings require
reading the material, viewing the lectures, and completing the task. While it's
not a requirement to respond to your classmates' posts on the forums, you will
benefit if you read through them, and I encourage you to do that.

Our four modules include:

- Module 1, on **Search**, will focus on searching general databases and search
  engines as well as on evaluating and managing search results.
- Module 2, on **Managing Information**, will focus on the tools and
  technologies we have available to us to begin collecting, managing, and using
  sources of information.
- Module 3, on **Special Information Sources**, will focus on more special
  databases---those databases that are topical and that, if used well, return
  solid research and data.
- Module 4, the last module, on **Personalizing Information**, we'll take
  managing information a step forward---that is, once we've learned how to
  collect information for later use, we'll begin to learn what can we do to
  take ownership of that information for use in other activities, such as
  writing.

One extra note about due dates in this course. As I stated earlier, all
discussion forums and assignments are contained in the four modules listed
above. There are six forums in the first module, two in the second, and so on.
Each discussion forum and assignment has a due date attached to it that are
generally spread about a week apart. Here's the bit---if you submit your
discussion post or assignment by its respective due date, you will receive
a little extra credit. But, you may submit, without any penalties, any
discussion post or assignment by the end of its module. If you submit your
discussion post or assignment by the end of its module (that is, past its
respective due date but before the last day of its respective module), that's
okay. You won't receive extra credit but you won't be penalized either.
However, if the last day of the module has passed, then work in that module is
now considered late. I will deduct 10% from that work on each day that it's
late, up to three days, and then not accept it, without an excused absence, if
it's submitted on the fourth day or after the end of its respective module. So,
if you manage your time well, you can earn a lot of extra credit over the
course of the semester. If not, then you easily lose a lot of points.

Regarding our assignments, we have five major assignments in this course, and
they are worth half of your final grade. The assignments and their short
descriptions are listed in the syllabus. The full descriptions are available in
Canvas in the Assignments section. The assignments include:

- Information Practices Journal 1 & 2: At the beginning of the course, you 
  will write a short reflection on your academic information practices. At the
  end of the course, you will write a follow up reflection, noting how your
  academic information practices have changed or might change due to the
  materials and practices learned in this course.
- Bibliographic Reference Managers: You will write an essay comparing and
  contrasting three separate bibliographic reference manager applications.
  Based on your analysis, you will select a bibliographic reference manager
  application to use in your studies.
- Wikipedia: Identify, Search, Collect, Annotate: You will select a Wikipedia 
  stub article to edit, and using your bibliographic reference manager,
  identify and annotate sources to add to the Wikipedia article.
- Wikipedia: Editing: You will edit your selected Wikipedia article by 
  adding additional text and revising existing text and support your changes
  with bibliographic references.

## Canvas

Back to Canvas---let me highlight the Syllabus section of the site. When you
click on the Syllabus link in the left side navigation section, you will have
a chance to read about the course's description, policies, assistance and tips
section, and the schedule and readings. It's important to review all of the
syllabus. By the way, you will find an Easter egg in the syllabus. That is, if
you read the syllabus, you'll find a gift that will make things a bit easier
for you. So read the syllabus.

On the Syllabus page, you'll see a Schedule. See also the link to the Calendar
on the left navigation bar. These are important tools to remind you what's
happening in the course and when assignments are due. You'll see due dates for
all course discussions and assignments here. Be sure to refer to this often to
stay current on upcoming work.

For most discussion topics, I will post a video lecture, usually of me going
through a series of slides, and a written transcript of that lecture. The
slides are all on Google Drive, and you are welcome to save them to your own
Drive account. You can also download the multimedia lectures and the
transcripts for later reference. Do note that I do not regurgitate course
readings---the lectures are largely supplemental to the readings and are not
a replacement for them. So do keep up on what are largely fairly easy going
readings in this course.

Lastly, online courses offer a lot of freedom but require extra effort in some
ways. Be sure to pay attention to notifications, emails, announcements, due
dates, and please refer to the syllabus often. All activities have due dates
and you must be careful with these or you can easily get behind. One important
tip: make sure you visit Canvas's notification area. You can do that by
clicking on your account. Set it so that Canvas sends you an email whenever
I post an announcement. It is your responsibility to stay on top of
communications about this course, and checking email and having email sent to
you by Canvas is paramount to accomplishing this. All of this is important
because for the summer session, we have to cover 15 weeks of material in about
half of the time.

If you have any questions, at any time during the semester, please feel free to
ask them in the General Questions, Comments, and Clarifications discussion
forum, or contact me personally through Canvas or email. I usually respond to
emails during the week quickly, but will not likely respond in the evening or
on weekends. If you have questions about an assignment, try not to ask during
the evening when it's due, because I likely will not be able to help you at
that point. 

I really enjoy teaching this class, and I hope you'll find the material as
useful as I do. So, welcome to the course and I'll see you online.
