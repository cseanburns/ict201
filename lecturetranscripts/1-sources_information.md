# IS/ICT 201: Personal Knowledge Management

## Sources of Information

Hi Class, welcome to the IS and ICT 201 course on **Personal Knowledge
Management**. This week we start with a brief discussion of what Knott refers to
as the "map of the information world." 

## The Information Sector

Knott begins her chapter with a discussion about the information
sector---Sector 51 as it's called by the [US Census Bureau][1] and other
governmental agencies and departments, such as the [US Economic Census][2], and
multiple industries. The number 51 refers to the NAICS code number [North
American Industry Classification System][3] for the information industry. NAICS
is a classification system of businesses according to the type of economic
activity those businesses engage in. We'll talk more about it in a later week,
but it's useful to know because it can be used to search in databases. The
information industry is defined as that sector which:

        comprises establishments engaged in the following processes: (a)
        producing and distributing information and cultural products, (b)
        providing the means to transmit or distribute these products as well as
        data or communication, and (c) processing data ([NAICS, 2012][5]).

(For more information about this industry, including statistical information
about the workforce, earnings, and more, visit the [Bureau of Labor
Statistics][4] page.)

This is a nice introduction to the map of the information world, because Knott's
example and main idea in this chapter is also one of the main ideas of this
course---that is, there is a multitude of information available to us via the
internet and the web, but this information is largely out of sight because it's
not easily visible to search engines like Google, Bing, Yahoo, or others. And
because it's out of sight, it requires an additional skill set to locate those
sources, retrieve them, manage it all, and then apply and use that information
in new ways. 

In short, information that is stored in databases, like the one pictured in
this slide, such as the Quarterly Financial Report for the information sector,
is not easily accessible via a search engine. Rather, in order to access this
data, you'd need to know that it exists, where it exists, and that it is
available to you. Once you know this, you can proceed to the source or the
resource, and retrieve it using a query or via a selection of menu items.
Sometimes this kind of data or information is only generated on the fly---based
on your search query---otherwise it does not have a standalone page---it does
not, that is, pre-exist as some URL.

## Database Terminology

Knott mentions various terms to describe databases. These include:

* databases
* database producers and publishers
* database vendors
* database platforms

This is a confusing mix of terminology, but the conceptual differences help us
identify and see what is available to us. In essence, we can think about these
terminological differences by comparing these terms to a more familiar resource,
like Google. Google is now a part of a bigger company called **Alphabet Inc.**,
which we can think of as the vendor. This company offers a search platform
called Google Search, as well as other platforms, like Google Photos, Google
Plus, and more. The index that Google Search creates when it crawls the web is
the actual database that we use when we use Google Search, and then of course
Google or Alphabet produces or publishes its own material.

In the image on this slide, EBSCOhost functions as the Database Vendor, and as
the vendor, offers a number of Database Platforms, such as Academic Search
Complete, Business Search Complete, and more, all of which you can search.

## Multiple Databases Available to You

Libraries, such as UK's, offers comparable if not more specialized products
than Google Search. These include EBSCOhost, ProQuest and Gale, among many
others. The vendors for these products supply multiple databases for accessing
subject focused information on a number of topics, and you can become familiar
with them by visiting the UK Libraries website, clicking on the Databases tab,
and searching the databases using a broad term, such as business, education,
psychology, marketing, and so forth. It's important to note that the sources
that these databases provide---that is, the information---is costly and thus
not easily available or seen by the regular search engine.

## Strategic Information Seeking

Why is it important to know about these databases and how to use them? Well,
for most of our everyday, mundane needs, the general search engine is great.
That is, it's really wonderful to live in this day in age---we have access to
more information and more quickly than we have had at any point in human
history. But if we assume that these search engines provide access to the
totality of information that's available, then we short ourselves. Sometimes,
the risks and the stakes are high and we need more in-depth and more thorough
information, and we need to be strategic about locating and using it---doing so
may save us from some costly mistakes. In such cases, it's not a matter of
making decisions based on inaccurate information but also perhaps on incomplete
information.

## Multiple DB Sources

Fortunately, if we only knew that we had more options, and if we only knew how
to leverage those options, then we could put ourselves on more secure footing.
Knott's chapter, and many examples in this book, focuses on General OneFile,
which is a database offered by Gale. General OneFile is more commonly offered
by public libraries. Don't dismiss public libraries and think they're only
about checking out books. Public libraries, like UK's library, generally offer
a number of databases. And State libraries and state consortiums, generally
also offer access to specific databases, like Kentucky's Virtual Library,
pictured here. Once you graduate from UK, you'll no longer have easy access to
UK Libraries' databases, but you can still access many of them through the
public library, via the computer you use to connect to the Internet.

## EBSCOhost

Let's take a quick look at a couple of UK Library's offerings. Here we have
pictured the first three databases provided by EBSCOhost, a database vendor. You
may have encountered Academic Search Complete in your other courses, but EBSCO
provides over 50 topical databases and the subject matter of these databases
range from music, psychology, education, ecology, and more. 

## ProQuest

Like EBSCOhost, ProQuest is another vendor that provides access to many subject
based databases. We have access to about half as many as offered by EBSCOhost,
and some of the topics overlap, but the sources are commonly different even if
the topics overlap. Plus, each of these vendors provides access to thousands of
scholarly journals, magazines, trade journals, newspapers, reports, blogs,
newspapers, dissertations, biographies, company reports, encyclopedias,
government publications, and much, much more.

## Free Resources

In our chapter this week, Knott also refers to a number of free resources. That
is, aside from the physical libraries you have access to, and the digital ones
such as KYVL.org, there are freely available databases on the Web too. The US
Government is one of the main sources of freely available information on the
web, but other industries participate in the free exchange of information too.
We'll cover some of these types in this course.

In our course shell on Canvas, I've created a very incomplete but nice list of
freely available databases on the web. Here's a screen shot, but do go to the
Pages section on Canvas, and click on the **Databases and Sources of
Information** page to access this list. Feel free to copy and save the list for
your own use.

## Copyright

With any of these sources of information, it's important to pay attention to
the copyright. Most information that's stored in databases (if not most
information on the Web itself), is under copyright. This means that you and I
have limited rights in using these sources of information. We can refer to such
work, we can extract the information from copyrighted work, but we cannot reuse
or share that work without express permission from the copyright holder, which
could be an individual person, a group of people, or a corporation. 

Fortunately, there's been a growing interest in the last decade plus in
licensing work under a Creative Commons license, and [Creative Commons][6] has
created a search engine to locate such work for reuse or modification. There
are different types of Creative Commons licenses---some are more permissible
than others. E.g., some work under CC licensing requires only that you
attribute the work. Another license says you can modify the work, but if you
do, you must also license it so that others can modify your work. And so on.
It's important to know which CC license a work has, if it has a CC license.

this slide and see what kind of material is available.

## & More

Remember, one of the main ideas of this course is that there are many sources of
information that are not easily available via Google or some other search
engine. Even when we do use Google or Bing or Yahoo or something else, there are
certain advanced tricks we can use to leverage them to find better information.
And if we apply what we'll learn in this class, we'll simply be better masters
of our own fate and our own knowledge.

In short, we are going to learn a bit more about what's hidden from most users
and from the common view---that which lies under the iceberg---and we'll learn a
bit about how to manage and apply these sources.

See you on the boards.
