<a class="header" href="3-information-sources-resources.html#primary-secondary-and-tertiary-sources" id="primary-secondary-and-tertiary-sources"><h2>Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary Sources</h2></a>
<p>It's true that just about anything can be a source of information,
but we generally think of information sources in a more scholarly way.
In that light, you likely already know about the differences between
<strong>primary</strong>, <strong>secondary</strong>, and <strong>tertiary</strong> sources.
Simply put, primary sources are more direct sources of information.
They are things that we might study for their own sake because
of their direct connection to some event, person, place, or thing.
A 17th century painting is a good example of a primary source,
but so is a scientific article that creates knowledge.</p>
<p>Secondary sources reflect on or refer to primary sources.
A commentary on a 17th century painting
or a review of the scientific literature are examples of secondary sources.
Despite these examples,
it's more helpful to think of the difference between
primary and secondary sources more contextually.
This is because a secondary source might be treated as a primary source.
For example, a researcher studying the history of art
might treat published art reviews as primary sources,
even if those reviews might traditionally be considered secondary sources
at the time they were created.</p>
<p>Tertiary sources are basically reference works.
These are things like dictionaries, general encylopedias, and like.</p>
<a class="header" href="3-information-sources-resources.html#resource-types" id="resource-types"><h2>Resource Types</h2></a>
<p>It can be helpful to know about the differences between
primary, secondary, and tertiary sources at times because
it's important, when dealing with an information source, to
understand what we're looking at or reading.
That is, primary, secondary, and tertiary sources say something
about the kind of evidence in those respective sources.
But another way to think about the differences between sources
is to think about the <strong>type of sources</strong> they are.
For example, if I do a <a href="https://saalck-uky.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/search?vid=01SAA_UKY:UKY">library search</a>,
I have the option to narrow my search by <strong>Resource Type</strong>.
Example resource types in UK's catalog include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Articles</li>
<li>Newspaper articles</li>
<li>Dissertations</li>
<li>Books</li>
<li>Book chapters</li>
<li>Review</li>
<li>Reports</li>
<li>Reference entries</li>
<li>Conference proceedings</li>
<li>Datasets</li>
<li>Maps</li>
<li>Images</li>
<li>Databases</li>
<li>Government documents</li>
<li>and more.</li>
</ul>
<a class="header" href="3-information-sources-resources.html#information-resources-of-information-sources" id="information-resources-of-information-sources"><h2>Information Resources of Information Sources</h2></a>
<p>A resource is really a thing that supplies a thing,
whatever that thing is.
For our purposes, we can think of information resources
as providers of information sources,
like those listed above.
One of the more important resources are databases,
and we can think of databases are great <strong>resources</strong>
for locating <strong>sources of information</strong>, but
the term <strong>database</strong> itself is a bit problematic because it has multiple
meanings, and I think it will help if we start this section by clarifying what
we mean in this course by the term <em>database</em>.</p>
<p>According to the
<a href="https://saalck-uky.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01SAA_UKY/ija67f/cdi_proquest_ebookcentral_EBC3312345"><em>Dictionary of Information Science and Technology</em></a>,
the term <strong>database</strong> can be defined as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a collection of files containing related information. Database consists of
files and each file consists of records. Furthermore, each record consists of
fields, which can be used to store the raw facts or data (p. 246).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This definition is not wrong, per se, but it is rather broad and therefore not
entirely useful. For example, the definition entails that if I have a folder on
my desktop, and if that folder contains only Excel spreadsheets on related
content, and since those spreadsheets contain only records (i.e., rows) and
fields (i.e., cells), then that folder on my desktop is a database. Although I
suppose that's kind of true, I don't think that's really what the dictionary
authors have in mind, and thus it's not an accurate enough nor a very useful
definition.</p>
<p>A more specific and applicable definition is provided by the
<a href="http://products.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_d#database"><em>Online Dictionary of Library and Information Science</em></a>,
which defines a <strong>database</strong> as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A large, regularly updated file of digitized information (bibliographic
records, abstracts, full-text documents, directory entries, images,
statistics, etc.) related to a specific subject or field, consisting of
records of uniform format organized for ease and speed of search and
retrieval and managed with the aid of database management system (DBMS)
software. Content is created by the database producer (for example, the
American Psychological Association), which usually publishes a print version
(Psychological Abstracts) and leases the content to one or more database
vendors (EBSCO, OCLC, etc.) that provide electronic access to the data after
it has been converted to machine-readable form (PsycINFO), usually on CD-ROM
or online via the Internet, using proprietary search software.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Most databases used in libraries are catalogs, periodical indexes,
abstracting services, and full-text reference resources leased annually under
licensing agreements that limit access to registered borrowers and library
staff. Abbreviated db. Compare with data bank. See also: archival database,
bibliographic database, embedded database, metadatabase, and niche database.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The above definition is more helpful because it provides examples of content
type (e.g., bibliographic records, abstracts, full-text documents, etc) and how
to access that content (e.g., library catalogs, periodical indexes), because it
partitions out the components of a database (records, search, retrieval), and
because it distinguishes a <em>database</em> proper from a <em>database management system
(DBMS)</em>, which is what the prior definition was attempting to define. The
ODLIS definition also highlights the role of database producers in producing
databases (e.g., the American Psychological Association), which tells us
something about the subject matter of a database (e.g., psychology).</p>
<a class="header" href="3-information-sources-resources.html#what-are-example-databases" id="what-are-example-databases"><h2>What are example databases?</h2></a>
<p>The ODLIS definition provides some leads to this question. The definition tells
us that example databases include &quot;digitized information containing
bibliographic records, abstracts, full-text documents, directory entries,
images, and statistics&quot; that are &quot;related to a specific field or subject,&quot; and
that these can be accessed through library &quot;catalogs, periodical indexes,
abstracting services, and full-text reference resources.&quot; Given that, let's
look at some examples.</p>
<a class="header" href="3-information-sources-resources.html#library-catalogs-and-discovery-services" id="library-catalogs-and-discovery-services"><h3>Library Catalogs and Discovery Services</h3></a>
<p>We'll start with the most general example, and that's the <strong>library catalog</strong>.
Traditionally, library catalogs were databases that primarily provided
information about where we could find content on a library's shelves (i.e.,
print content). However, given that more content is available online, nowadays
these catalogs are more often referred to as discovery services. In this
expanded role, not only can they tell us where to find a book on a shelf, but
they can also provide full text access to online content in other databases.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We can access the University of Kentucky's library catalog/discovery service
at their main website at:</p>
<p><a href="https://libraries.uky.edu/"><strong>https://libraries.uky.edu</strong></a></p>
<p>Please visit the link and test your own searches.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the center of UK Libraries' homepage, we find two tabs of interest, the
<strong>Search</strong> tab and the <strong>Library Catalog</strong> tab. If we enter a search term in
the search box for either of those resources, our search will take us to the
same interface. That's because there's really only a small difference between
how the functions <strong>Search</strong> and <strong>Library Catalog</strong> work. The <strong>Search</strong>
function will return results, based on a search query, for print items located
on the library's shelves but also for online items located in various other
databases. The <strong>Library Catalog</strong> will do the same, but it'll place a bit more
emphasis on locating print items on the library's shelves. Searching one or the
other then is really simply a matter of emphasis.</p>
<p>Regardless, both services return what are called <strong>bibliographic records</strong> and
not full text access. These bibliographic records do not provide the actual
content. Rather, they provide access by telling us where to locate the content.
For example, if that content is a print item someplace on the library's
shelves, the catalog might tell us it's located on the 5th floor of WT Young
and has the call number <strong>Z674.82.159 S42 1996</strong>, or something like that.
However, if that content is online, then the catalog should give us a direct
link to it. It could also be that the UK Libraries catalog has records for
information sources but not the actual sources themselves. In those cases, the
bibliographic records should provide a link to request the item through
interlibrary loan (ILL).</p>
<p>Google and other search engines function in much the same way. If I do a search
for the term <strong>databases</strong> in Google, the search engine will return results to
sites that are relevant to that term, like a Wikipedia article on databases.
Google itself does not store the full text content and only provides access
(i.e., links) to content based on its own indexing of where things are on the
web. Unlike the library's catalog, if Google returns results for pages it
cannot access or that don't exist anymore, there is no ILL service offered, and
we're left to our own devices to find access to that information.</p>
<a class="header" href="3-information-sources-resources.html#periodical-indexes-and-abstracting-services" id="periodical-indexes-and-abstracting-services"><h3>Periodical Indexes and Abstracting Services</h3></a>
<p>The library catalogs and discovery services that I described above return a
wide variety of bibliographic records that describe and provide access to
books, ebooks, book chapters, maps, scholarly articles, news articles, images,
and more. While the discovery service part of the search that we explored above
functions as a kind of catchall for all the types of works that a library can
provide access to, as just listed, there will be times when we will want to
focus our search to a more limited subset of records, such as those that
produced by periodicals.</p>
<p>Periodicals are nothing more than magazines and journals. This kind of genre
produces issues at regular (or even at irregular) intervals, such as weekly,
bimonthly, monthly, or quarterly issues, with no pre-determined end.
Periodicals focus on different audiences, such as the general public (e.g.,
Time magazine), parts of the general public (e.g., <em>WIRED</em>, <em>Elle</em>, <em>Better
Homes and Gardens</em>), the general scholarly community (e.g., <em>Nature</em>,
<em>Science</em>), or to specific scholarly communities (e.g, <em>Journal of Information
Technology</em>, <em>Journal of Synchrotron Radiation</em>, <em>Journal of Sociology</em>).
Scholarly journals are generally (but not always) peer-reviewed journals, which
means that when authors submit their manuscripts to these journals, the
manuscripts are sent out to two to three peers in the scholarly community who
read the manuscripts and write recommendations to the editors for improving the
manuscript, or who recommend that the journal editor reject the manuscript.
Different journals and different scholarly disciplines have different criteria
for making judgments on quality.</p>
<p>There are two broad ways to locate sources in periodicals. At the UK Libraries
<a href="https://libraries.uky.edu/">homepage</a>, we can select the <strong>Journals</strong> tab or the
<strong>Databases</strong> tab. The <strong>Journals</strong> tab lets us search for specific journal
titles and, if desired, within disciplinary/subject categories (e.g., Health &amp;
Biological Sciences, Law, Politics &amp; Government, Language &amp; Literature, or
Social Sciences, Journalism &amp; Communications, and more). Once we locate a
journal of interest, we can visit the link and then search within that journal
or peruse the table of contents for specific issues.</p>
<p>The <strong>Databases</strong> tab lets us expand our search of records to broader
categories or subject areas of periodicals. Here we find databases like
<a href="https://libguides.uky.edu/4"><em>Academic Search Complete</em></a>, which will let us search thousands of
periodicals, including magazines and scholarly journals, across a range of
subject categories. <em>JSTOR</em> is another database that indexes a broad subject
range of periodicals but with greater emphasis on peer-reviewed material.
Databases may also have a specific focus. For example, the
<a href="http://ezproxy.uky.edu/login?url=https://www.aac.amdigital.co.uk/"><em>African American Communities</em></a>
database provides access to archival and historical papers,
oral histories, essays, letters, pamphlets, and newspapers on African American
communities and is geographically focused on Atlanta, Chicago, New York, and
parts of North Carolina. Then we also have access to databases like the
<em>Kentucky Building Code</em>, which is a database that links to residential and
commercial regulatory information on building, plumbing, design in Kentucky.</p>
<p>Many of the resources listed above, as well as the hundreds that UK Libraries
offers and that I have not described, provide access to full-text content. But
this isn't necessarily so. All that a periodical index must offer to be
classified as such are records that contain basic information, such as article
titles, author names, publication names, publication date information, and
often subject terms. Abstracting services provide the same information but also
provide abstracts of journal articles, which are searchable. Since abstracts
provide summary information of the main articles, this is helpful in locating
information sources.</p>
<a class="header" href="3-information-sources-resources.html#full-text-resources" id="full-text-resources"><h3>Full-text Resources</h3></a>
<p>Periodical indexes and abstracting services do not necessarily provide direct
full text access. You might wonder what the point is if you can't get the full
text of some source that the library tells you exists. The point is that even
if the library doesn't have immediate access to a source, if it can tell you
that it exists, then a librarian can likely get the source through interlibrary
loan (which is fast!) or some other means. So if the stakes are high (e.g., you
are a cancer researcher) and you really need or just want information (e.g.,
about a cancer therapy), then periodical indexes and abstracting services are
great resources even if they do not provide immediate full text access.</p>
<p>That said, in addition to a variety of periodical indexes and abstracting
services, UK Libraries provides quite a few full text databases. Visit the
<a href="https://libguides.uky.edu/az.php">A-Z Databases page</a> to see all of your choices. A full-text database
may also be an abstracting service, if it provides the basic information listed
above (title, author name, etc) about periodical content. It becomes a
full-text abstracting database if it also provides access to the full-text
source. Other non-periodical database, like the <em>African American Communities</em>
database, also provides full text access to its sources (and may even be
thought of as a <em>digital library</em> and not just a database).</p>
<p>In the next few paragraphs below, I will focus on a few general purpose
full-text databases that you may find helpful as you work towards your degree.
Although these databases provide full-text sources, they may not provide
full-text to everything they have records for, though.</p>
<a class="header" href="3-information-sources-resources.html#academic-search-complete" id="academic-search-complete"><h4>Academic Search Complete</h4></a>
<p><a href="https://libguides.uky.edu/4"><em>Academic Search Complete (ASC)</em></a> is a database of databases. It can
search over 60 different databases and indexes, each including hundreds of
journal titles, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Communication and Mass Media Complete</em></li>
<li><em>Sociological Collection</em></li>
<li><em>Music Index</em></li>
<li><em>SPORTDiscus</em></li>
<li><em>MEDLINE</em></li>
<li><em>eBook K-8 Collection</em>,</li>
<li>and more.</li>
</ul>
<p>In ASC, we can search all 60 plus databases at one time, or we can select one
or more of them, which might make better sense. For example, if we were
interested health related information, we might want to search the following
ASC databases at once:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Consumer Health Reference eBook Collection</em></li>
<li><em>Health and Psychosocial Instruments</em></li>
<li><em>MEDLINE</em></li>
<li><em>APA PsycInfo</em></li>
</ul>
<a class="header" href="3-information-sources-resources.html#proquest" id="proquest"><h4>ProQuest</h4></a>
<p>Like ASC, <a href="https://libguides.uky.edu/90">ProQuest</a> provides access to many subject based databases,
and also, many of the database topics overlap. ProQuest uses this to highlight
database collections. For example, the <em>SciTech Premium Collection</em> includes
three databases that can be searched at once. These include the:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Natural Science Collection</em></li>
<li><em>Science Database</em></li>
<li><em>Technology Collection</em></li>
</ul>
<p>ProQuest's <em>Social Science Premium Collection</em> includes databases on
criminology, education, library and information science, politics, sociology,
and more.</p>
<p>ProQuest also provides database access to magazines and news content, including
<em>The Vogue Archive</em> and various current and historical newspapers, such as an
archive of <em>The New York Times</em> or current issues of <em>The Courier-Journal</em>
(Louisville, KY).</p>
<a class="header" href="3-information-sources-resources.html#jstor" id="jstor"><h4>JSTOR</h4></a>
<p><a href="https://libguides.uky.edu/266"><em>JSTOR</em></a> is another multi-disciplinary database. JSTOR covers subjects
such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Arts</li>
<li>Business &amp; Economics</li>
<li>History</li>
<li>Medicine &amp; Allied Health</li>
<li>Science &amp; Mathematics</li>
<li>Security studies</li>
<li>Social Sciences, and more.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these subject areas includes access to many journal titles, and
therefore, many journal articles. <em>JSTOR</em> has long focused on back issues of
journals, but in recent years has made moves to include current literature and
open access content (this content that is freely available). <em>JSTOR</em> also
includes <a href="https://www.artstor.org/public-collections/"><em>ARTSTOR</em></a>, a database of images, video, and other
multimedia content, much of which is also available as open access.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: Open access (OA) content is content that

That does not, however, mean that the content is
free of copyright protections.
There are different types of OA copyright licenses
and each will stipulate how we can use that content.

</blockquote>
<a class="header" href="3-information-sources-resources.html#conclusion" id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2></a>
<p>Remember, one of the main ideas of this course is that there are many sources of
information that are not easily available via Google or some other search
engine. Even when we do use Google or Bing or Yahoo or something else, there are
certain advanced tricks we can use to leverage them to find better information.
And if we apply what we'll learn in this class, we'll simply be better masters
of our own fate and our own knowledge.</p>
<p>In short, we are going to learn a bit more about what's hidden from most users
and from the common view---that which lies under the iceberg---and we'll learn a
bit about how to manage and apply these sources.</p>
