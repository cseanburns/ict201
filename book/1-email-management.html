<a class="header" href="1-email-management.html#introduction" id="introduction"><h2>Introduction</h2></a>
<p>Many people today use a variety of social media and text messaging platforms to
communicate with each other, and this is on top of, or in spite of, the
existence and use of email, which still reigns as the dominant mode of
communication across a variety of industries. We can refer to this experience
of the abundance of communication platforms and the abundance of messaging on
these platforms as <em>communication overload</em>. This concept basically means that
there are too many messages coming at us from too many platforms.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it's beyond the scope of this lecture to address strategies for
managing communication from across multiple platforms, but since email reigns
supreme as a form of communication across industry, it's important to learn
some strategies for managing our emails and avoiding inboxes with hundreds or
thousands of unread email.</p>
<a class="header" href="1-email-management.html#strategies" id="strategies"><h2>Strategies</h2></a>
<p>The first set of readings listed above focus on overall strategies for managing
our email inboxes. The readings suggest a number of strategies, but the two
main strategies focus on 1) <strong>organizing our email</strong> and 2) <strong>searching for
email</strong>. Some of the specific suggestions they make to implement those
strategies will depend upon whether we use email in the web browser, via a
desktop application, or a phone app. Thus it may take some exploration to
figure out how to apply these lessons based on what you use.</p>
<a class="header" href="1-email-management.html#organization" id="organization"><h3>Organization</h3></a>
<p>Each email service we use (e.g., Outlook, Gmail, etc.) offers similar but also
different ways to organize our email. Here are some ways to organize your
emails:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Create folders (Outlook) or labels (Gmail), and then archive or group your
email.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create rules to filter your email to specific folders or label your emails
with specific labels.</p>
<p>For example, I have several folders in Outlook. I have a folder titled
'university email' and a rule that sends all email from UK officials and UK
mailings lists to that account. I have another folder titled 'Canvas
email', where all email from my courses are routed to. And so on. Most of
these emails are not time-sensitive (e.g., mailing list email) or it's
simply helpful to group email by category (e.g., Canvas student email), and
using them, therefore, helps keep email organized. As a student, you might
want to create folders for specific courses, specific majors/minors,
administrative functions (registration related emails, for example) and
like.</p>
<p>Gmail doesn't use the terms <strong>rules</strong> or <strong>folders</strong>, per say, but instead
uses the concept of <strong>filters</strong> and <strong>labels</strong>. Gmail will automatically
assign labels to your email, but you can apply more personalized labels.
And then you can set up filters that automatically assigns labels that
match the logic you set up with the filters.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<a class="header" href="1-email-management.html#searching" id="searching"><h3>Searching</h3></a>
<p>All email services provide some kind of search, even if implemented in
different ways. And like regular search engines, Outlook and Gmail both offer
advanced searching abilities.</p>
<p>In Outlook, you can search:</p>
<ul>
<li>in specific folders</li>
<li>by who an email is <strong>From</strong></li>
<li>by who you sent an <strong>To</strong></li>
<li>by a <strong>CC</strong> (carbon cop) address or person</li>
<li>by <strong>Subject</strong> line</li>
<li>by <strong>Keywords</strong> (that may appear in the email message),</li>
<li>within specific dates,</li>
<li>and you can limit results to specific dates</li>
</ul>
<p>In Gmail, you can do most of same kinds of things, but you can also:</p>
<ul>
<li>search by email size</li>
<li>and exclude emails that do not include certain terms</li>
</ul>
<p>Searches are very similar to filters, and in fact, in both Outlook and Gmail,
you can save a search as a filter if you find that your search query can be
re-used.</p>
<p>Searching not only helps you find specific emails on specific topics and within
specific time frames, it's also a good way to mass delete old and unnecessary
email.</p>
<a class="header" href="1-email-management.html#other-strategies" id="other-strategies"><h3>Other Strategies</h3></a>
<p>Both the <em>PC Mag</em> and <em>The Washington Post</em> articles suggest that <strong>we turn off
notifications</strong>. The point is that if we receive a lot of emails, then email
itself becomes too distracting. Instead, <em>The Washington Post</em> suggests that we
simply <strong>check our email only a few times per day</strong> (but probably at most twice
a day is sufficient). The aim here is to be intentional about using email (and
this applies to any other communication technology) rather than mindless and
distracted by it.</p>
<p><em>The Washington Post</em> article also suggests applying <strong>the four Ds</strong> to your
emails: &quot;<strong>do, delete, delegate or defer</strong>. It's up to you how to implement
these ideas, but the main goal is to get rid of unnecessary email fast. Don't
let it accumulate. The more emails that sit in our inbox, the more overwhelming
it becomes afterward. In fact, <strong>unsubscribe</strong> to everything that is not
important.</p>
<p>Another good idea is to keep personal and work email separate. In fact, have
more than one personal email account. Use one personal as a throwaway account
for signing up to random websites. Use your main personal account for personal
communication, banking, important social media accounts, and like. Use your
work account or your school account for work or school related tasks only. Be
mindful that your work or school account does not belong to you and that you
will lose that account when you leave a job or graduate from school. In fact,
the University of Kentucky has a <a href="https://uknow.uky.edu/student-and-academic-life/graduating-what-do-your-uk-accounts-and-mail-you-go">help page about your various UK
accounts</a> that you should read now.</p>
<p>As your lives become increasingly busy, in they're not already, using good
Calendar and Task apps can help keep our days organized and our to-do lists
manageable. Both Outlook and Gmail integrate <strong>Tasks</strong> and <strong>Calendars</strong>. The
readings above link to help pages on how to use these functions. These are
super time-saving functions for me.</p>
<a class="header" href="1-email-management.html#conclusion" id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2></a>
<p>In addition to managing our personal knowledge, one of the main points of this
class is to become adept at using the various technologies that are available
to us. If we're only passive users of technology, then that technology can
easily overwhelm us. Active and intentional use of technology and of the
specific functions that services provide can actually help improve our lives
and our personal knowledge management work flows.</p>
<p>In this lesson, we learned how to think strategically about email services. The
two main strategies involve how to:</p>
<ul>
<li>organize our email, and how to</li>
<li>search our email.</li>
</ul>
