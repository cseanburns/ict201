# Welcome to Using Information Resources and Managing Information Sources

Hello and welcome to this
part of our course
where we begin preparing
for the final project,
which is editing a
selected Wikipedia article.
To begin, we're going to focus
on two key components that are
vital for anyone delving
into the world of
personal knowledge management.

First, we'll explore how to
find, select, and utilize
various information resources.
You'll learn to navigate through
the information out there and
pinpoint what's relevant for your needs.
This will academic databases,
online journals, and
other digital libraries.
You will acquire the
skills to access and
make the most of these resources.

In the next section,
we'll dive into the
practical world of **Reference Managers**,
with a special focus on Zotero.
Reference managers are used to
support your research and information organization.
Specifically,
Zotero is a powerful application that helps 
manage bibliographic data and related research materials.
We'll walk through its features,
from the basics of adding sources
to generating bibliographies.

This section lays the foundation
for the rest of the course.
The skills and concepts you acquire and learn here
will be integral to your success
in managing information effectively,
both in this course and
in your broader academic or professional endeavors.
