# Welcome to Using Information Resources and Managing Information Sources

Hello and welcome to this
crucial section of our course!
Going forward,
we begin preparing
for the final project
of the course,
which is editing a
selected Wikipedia article.
To begin, we're going to focus
on two key components that are
vital for anyone delving
into the world of information management.

First, we'll explore how to effectively
find, select, and utilize
various information resources.
You'll learn to navigate through
the information out there and
pinpoint what's relevant for your needs.
Whether it's academic databases,
online journals, or
other digital libraries,
you will be equipped with
the skills to access and
make the most of these resources.

In the next section,
we'll dive into the
practical world of **Reference Managers**,
with a special focus on Zotero.
This is more than just learning a tool;
it's about mastering an essential skill
that will support your research and information organization.
Zotero is a powerful ally in
managing bibliographic data and related research materials.
We'll walk through its features,
from the basics of adding sources
to generating bibliographies.

This section lays the foundation
for the rest of our course.
The skills you acquire here
will be integral to your success
in managing information effectively,
both in this course and
in your broader academic or professional endeavors.
