# Introduction to Personal Knowledge Management

## What is personal knowledge management (PKM)?

What is personal knowledge management (PKM)?
Well, I'd hazard a guess that most of us depend
largely on two main sources to search for, locate, and retrieve information,
either on a daily basis or for more extensive work.
These two sources are the people we know and the search engines,
like Google, that we use on a daily basis.
Relying on these two kinds of sources may get us by for most things,
but there are times when we will require more rigorous sources
because the task at hand stipulates better information or
the risks involved in making a decision
are weighty enough to require more certainty.
Good, thorough information can reduce our uncertainty or
enable us to measure levels of uncertainty, and
this is helpful when making decisions, writing papers, completing projects,
and so forth.
In this course, therefore, our first
learning goal is focused on **information sources**, and
specifically, to:

- become aware of other sources of information,
- learn how to search those sources for relevant information, and
- learn how to evaluate found information.

This only covers part of what we mean by personal knowledge management.
In addition to being able to search for, locate, and retrieve good information,
it is also important to manage that information and
to develop good work flows that help with that.
What I mean is that,
it may be great that we know that
[UK Libraries][uklibraries]
exists and that we can use it to locate good information, but
if we don't ever use UK Libraries or other great resources
because we're not in the habit of doing so,
then what's the point?
Shouldn't we live in the **good information age** 
rather than merely the **information age**?

Therefore, our second learning goal is focused
on the tools and technologies that will help us
build personalized information and knowledge work flows.
As stated above,
often the point of acquiring good information is
to perform some task or to make a decision.
A good work flow is good if it fits our style,
or our way of getting things done,
because that makes the work flow more likely to be followed.
A good work flow also maximizes our use of good sources of
information as well as helps us to produce desired outcomes,
like a paper for a class, a project for a boss, or
a decision that involves some uncertainty.
Our second learning goal is, therefore,
focused on **personal knowledge work flows**,
and specifically, to: 

- to become aware of the tools and technologies designed to manage personal
  knowledge work flows,
- to learn how to use these tools and technologies, and
- to incorporate these tools and technologies into our personal knowledge work
  flows

Our final learning goal **focuses on outcomes** and
builds off the first two goals.
Specifically, our goal is to habitually use
the tools and technologies that incorporate
a variety of good sources of information
in order to accomplish a task or make a decision.
That is, not only may we want to take advantage
of the many kinds of information sources that exist, and
not only may we want to make
it a habit of using those information sources
in a habitual, personalized way, but
we may also, as suggested earlier,
want to accomplish some task.
It could be that we may simply want to
satisfy our curiosity about a topic and learn more,
which is great!
But there are times in our lives when we need to get things done
(e.g., write a paper or create a software program) or
make a decision that involves some risk
(e.g., buy a house or choose a healthcare procedure).
In those cases, having a personal knowledge work flow that
incorporates high quality sources of information
will facilitate accomplishing such tasks or making such decisions.

### Course Requirements

Back to Canvas---let me highlight the Syllabus section of the site. When you
click on the Syllabus link in the left side navigation section, you will have
a chance to read about the course's description, policies, assistance and tips
section, and the schedule and readings. It's important to review all of the
syllabus. By the way, you will find an Easter egg in the syllabus. That is, if
you read the syllabus, you'll find a gift that will make things a bit easier
for you. So read the syllabus.

On the Syllabus page, you'll see a Schedule. See also the link to the Calendar
on the left navigation bar. These are important tools to remind you what's
happening in the course and when assignments are due. You'll see due dates for
all course discussions and assignments here. Be sure to refer to this often to
stay current on upcoming work.

For most discussion topics, I will post a video lecture, usually of me going
through a series of slides, and a written transcript of that lecture. The
slides are all on Google Drive, and you are welcome to save them to your own
Drive account. You can also download the multimedia lectures and the
transcripts for later reference. Do note that I do not regurgitate course
readings---the lectures are largely supplemental to the readings and are not
a replacement for them. So do keep up on what are largely fairly easy going
readings in this course.

Lastly, online courses offer a lot of freedom but require extra effort in some
ways. Be sure to pay attention to notifications, emails, announcements, due
dates, and please refer to the syllabus often. All activities have due dates
and you must be careful with these or you can easily get behind. One important
tip: make sure you visit Canvas's notification area. You can do that by
clicking on your account. Set it so that Canvas sends you an email whenever
I post an announcement. It is your responsibility to stay on top of
communications about this course, and checking email and having email sent to
you by Canvas is paramount to accomplishing this. All of this is important
because for the summer session, we have to cover 15 weeks of material in about
half of the time.

If you have any questions, at any time during the semester, please feel free to
ask them in the General Questions, Comments, and Clarifications discussion
forum, or contact me personally through Canvas or email. I usually respond to
emails during the week quickly, but will not likely respond in the evening or
on weekends. If you have questions about an assignment, try not to ask during
the evening when it's due, because I likely will not be able to help you at
that point. 

I really enjoy teaching this class, and I hope you'll find the material as
useful as I do. So, welcome to the course and I'll see you online.
