# Wikipedia Project: Setup

By the end of this course,
you will edit several Wikipedia articles.
This guide provides
an introduction to contributing to Wikipedia.
While actual editing won't begin
until later in the course,
it's important to start
learning the process now
in order to plan and prepare.

The goal:
Wikipedia's accuracy and credibility
depend on good references in its articles.
Good references allow readers
to verify information and explore topics further.
By adding references to Wikipedia articles,
this project will also serve
as a valuable learning exercise:
it will allow you to develop your research,
critical thinking, and information evaluation skills,
all while contributing to a valuable online resource.
In short,
this project will encourage you
to draw upon all the topics
we have covered since we started this course.

## Readings

Please review this article on it:

## Becoming a Wikipedia Editor

In this course, the main assignment involves identifying
three Wikipedia articles,
searching for information sources
from the library and the web
to add to the articles,
collecting those sources
in your reference manager (RM),
and then editing the Wikipedia articles
by adding your references to them.

So far, we have covered the following topics that
will help us with our project:

1. Information sources and resources
2. Reference managers
3. Web information retrieval
4. Database information retrieval
5. Evaluating information sources

For the remainder of the course,
we will continue to cover specific library and web resources,
how to use them, and
how to incorporate them into our work flows.
By the end of the semester,
you should have collected enough material to
edit the Wikipedia articles
that you have identify this week.

## Details

For this week, your task is
to identify three Wikipedia articles to edit.
You may choose any articles, but
**[note that some articles have stricter editing policies][wikipedia_policies]**.
You will analyze the article for lack of references
or articles that need more references, and
collect sources that will address those shortcomings
using the search skills and resource knowledge you have
acquired this semester.
For the main project,
you will need to add two references
to each of the three articles.
Overall, you will need to identify
three sources from the library
and three from the general web.
At the end of this semester,
in the second part of this project,
you will edit the Wikipedia articles, and
add your references to the articles
that you identified.

For now, your job is to:

- Create an account on Wikipedia (if you do not already have one).
- Identify three Wikipedia articles that you would like to add references to.
- Begin to collect and describe at least six sources over the course of the
  next few weeks.
  - Three sources will come from the library.
  - Three sources will come from the general web.

For this week, you will submit to the discussion board a post that
describes your activities.
Your post should respond to the following:

1. Provide your **Wikipedia account name** *and* a link to your Wikipedia
   homepage.
    - For example, my account name is **Cseanburns** and my Wikipedia homepage
      is [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Cseanburns][cseanburns].
    - You must edit your Wikipedia homepage and add some basic biographical
      information. **Note: it's not necessary to identify yourself as a student
      or use your **linkblue** username for this assignment.**
2. Provide the title of the stub article that you would like to edit and a link
   to the page.
    - For example, I might choose the **Information retrieval** article, which is
      located at [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_retrieval][info_retrieval]
3. State why you chose these articles.
