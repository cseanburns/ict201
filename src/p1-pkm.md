This short book 
was written and developed for 
a course on personal knowledge management taught at the
University of Kentucky's School of Information Science.

## How to Use this Book

### Text and Video

Most sections of this book will be accompanied
by a video demonstrating the practices described in those sections.
Try to read through the text first, and
then watch the video.
Revisit the text to help cement the ideas in place.

### Markup

There are two markups that I want to bring to your attention:

Text that looks like **code blocks** indicate some kind
of command that you should test for yourself.
For example, I demonstrate search queries in the 
sections that follow.
When I demonstrate a Google search, for example,
the search query will appear in a standalone box
with a basic font and a different color background
(depending on the theme you're using).

```

I occassionally insert some **asides** into the text.
These asides generally contain notes or extra comments
about the main content.
Asides look like this:

> This is an aside.
> Asides will contain extra information, notes, or comments.

### Theme

At the top of the page is an icon of paint brush.
The default theme is darker text on a light background,
but you can change the theme per your preferences.

### Printing

I intend this book to be a live document, and
therefore it'll be regularly updated.
But feel free to print it, if you want.
You can use the print function
to save the entire book as a PDF file.
See the printer icon at the top left of the screen
to get started.
