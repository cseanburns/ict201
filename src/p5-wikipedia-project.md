# Welcome to Your Wikipedia Project Adventure!

We now embark on the final leg
of our journey in this course, and
it's time to put your
newly acquired skills to the test.
Welcome, therefore, to the section
where you'll learn how to contribute
to one of the
largest knowledge repositories
on the internet: Wikipedia!

First off,
Wikipedia isn't just any website;
it has its own style, rules, and community.
We'll cover how to edit Wikipedia articles
in a way that fits with
Wikipedia's unique format and expectations.
This will help you contribute effectively
to this knowledge platform.

Choosing the right articles is crucial.
The articles should be on topics
that you're interested in and
where you can make a meaningful contribution.
We'll discuss strategies
to help you select
the perfect article
that aligns with your
interests and the needs
of the Wikipedia community.

Then, it's all about research.
You have already learned some
things about searching
library databases and the web,
and going forward,
you'll learn how to use
**specific library and web resources**
to find reliable information
for your chosen Wikipedia articles.

Finally, we'll tackle
how to use your **Reference Manager**
to save and curate your found sources.
Organizing your research is
key to making
your Wikipedia editing
process smooth and stress-free.

This section isn't just about learning;
it's about making a real-world
impact by enhancing
the quality of information available
to millions of people and
contributing to the
collective knowledge of the world!
