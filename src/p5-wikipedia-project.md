# Welcome to Your Wikipedia Project Adventure!

As we embark on the final leg
of our journey in this course,
it's time to put your
newly acquired skills to the test.
Welcome to the exciting section
where you'll be contributing
to one of the
largest knowledge repositories
on the internet: Wikipedia!

First off,
we'll get into **Writing for Wikipedia**.
Wikipedia isn't just any website;
it has its own style, rules, and community.
We'll cover how to write
in a way that fits
Wikipedia's unique format and expectations.
This is your chance
to learn how to contribute effectively
to this vast knowledge platform.

Next, we'll move to **Wikipedia Project: Setup**.
Choosing the right article is crucial.
It should be a topic you're interested in and
where you can make a meaningful contribution.
We'll discuss strategies
to help you select
the perfect article
that aligns with your
interests and the needs
of the Wikipedia community.

Then, it's all about research.
You'll learn how to use
**Specific Library and Web Resources**
to find reliable sources
for your chosen Wikipedia article.
Navigating through these resources
will be a breeze
with the skills
you've already honed in our course.

Finally, we'll tackle
how to use your **Reference Manager**
to save and curate your found sources.
Organizing your research is
key to making
your Wikipedia editing
process smooth and stress-free.

This section isn't just about learning;
it's about making a real-world
impact by enhancing
the quality of information available
to millions of people and
contributing to the
collective knowledge of the world!
