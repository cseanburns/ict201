# Working with Generative AI

Understanding and utilizing Generative AI
as a Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) tool
can be a useful way
to using applications
like
[ChatGPT][chatgpt],
[Claude][claude],
[Bard][bard],
and others.
There are two fundamental keys
to success:

- asking good questions, and
- engaging in lengthened exchanges with the AI.

These interactions are not
only about getting answers;
they're about generating ideas,
creating content, and
making informed decisions,
which you'll further enrich
with credible information
from library and web sources
later in the semester.

In this section,
we'll delve into
the science of **Prompt Engineering**.
This is the act of crafting
your questions and commands
in a way that guides the AI
to understand and respond
with the most useful and
relevant information.
A well-constructed prompt
can be the difference between
getting a generic response and
unlocking truly valuable insights.

## Reading

Below I demonstrate a session
with Google Bard
where I construct a series
of prompts for Bard
to talk about prompt engineering.
The goal of the session
was to show how
using generative AI effectively
is iterative,
which means that
I apply answers from Bard
to generate new responses.

This session is based on
readings from several sources.
Before reading through the session,
please review the following
guides on prompt engineering
tactics and techniques:

- [OpenAI's Prompt Engineering Guide][openai_prompt_eng]

The above link outlines the
importance of the following
in interacting with
generative AI:

1. **Write Clear Instructions**: The clearer your request, the better the AI can meet your needs.
2. **Provide Reference Text**: Supplying context or examples can significantly steer the AI towards the kind of response you're looking for.
3. **Split Complex Tasks into Simpler Subtasks**: Breaking down bigger challenges makes them more manageable for the AI.
4. **Give Generative AI Models Time to Think**: Sometimes, complex queries require a moment for the AI to process and respond thoughtfully.
5. **Using External Tools**: Learn how to integrate other tools and resources to augment the AI's capabilities.
6. **Testing Changes Systematically**: Experiment and evaluate how different approaches impact the AI's responses.

- [Prompt Engineering Guide][prompt_engineering_guide]

The above site provides important
information on prompting.
The **Examples of Prompts** page
covers the following topics
on ways to use generative AI:

- text summarization
- information extraction
- question answering
- text classification
- conversation
- code generation
- reasoning

In the **Techniques** section,
the Prompt Engineering Guide
describes multiple ways to engage
with generative AI.
The first few items listed
are good entry level approaches
to construct prompts.
These include:

- zero-shot prompting
- few-shot prompting
- chain-of-thought prompting

And more.
Please read through these techniques.

## Prompt Exchange with Google Bard

The following is a link
to a session I conducted with Google Bard.
In this session,
I prompt Bard about prompt engineering,
and then work with Bard
to provide some examples
that demonstrate
**few-shot prompting** and
**chain-of-thought** prompting.
I then ask Bard to show
I could have improved my prompts,
and it offers some suggestions.
See the link below
to read through the session:

- [Prompt Engineering: Crafting Instructions for AI][prompt_example]

## Google NotebookLM

One of the downsides
right now with generative AI clients
is that most applications
do not integrate a work flow
for using sessions with AI
into creating outputs,
like essays.
This is what something like
Google's new [NotebookLM][notebooklm]
seeks to solve.

For example,
in the prior session with Bard,
I asked Bard if it would
offer suggestions for improving
my prompts in a
use case involving using
generative AI to develop
a strategy for
writing an essay
on the ethics of generative AI.
Bard offered the following advice:

- add specificity within steps
- provide examples and case studies
- provide alternate perspectives
- prompt for creative solutions

To apply these suggestions
using [NotebookLM][notebooklm],
I can add my own documents and data.
NotebookLM lets users
create topical notebooks
and then add data from
their Google Drive accounts,
PDFs, and from copied text.
By doing this,
I would be able to address
Bard's suggestions to
provide examples and case studies
and to provide alternate perspectives
on a topic
as I collect information from
the library or the web. 

## Conclusion

Generative AI is a fairly new
technology that offers a lot of potential
for personal knowledge management.
In this lesson,
we learned how to use
generative AI effectively
by engaging in lengthy sessions
that involve creating well-constructed prompts.
To construct good prompts,
we employed tactics such as
**few-shot prompting** and
**chain-of-thought** prompting.

With new tools such as
Google's NotebookLM,
we learned how to
incorporate our own data
that we have collected to
continue to work on our prompts
and to generate new content,
ideas, and perhaps even, knowledge.
