# Reference Managers: Closing the Loop

At this point in the course,
you should have built up a decent library
of information sources in your Zotero library for your Wikipedia project.
You may have even been using it for your other courses.
(If not, then start!)
If you need to collect more sources for your Wikipedia article,
this is the time to do it.

In the last few weeks of this course,
your final goal is to edit your chosen Wikipedia article
based on the information resources you've collected.

In order to prepare for the Wikipedia edit,
it's time to go back to your Zotero collection
and begin to add (more) notes,
refine and edit those notes,
synthesize them,
and begin writing content for your Wikipedia article.

Zotero and other reference managers offer a number of tools
to help with this process.
As a reminder,
you can use your Zotero browser plugin to automatically add
information sources to your Zotero library.
You can store those sources in folders in your Zotero library.
A folder can be project based.
You can also tag each information source for more organization.
You can highlight and add notes to PDF copies in Zotero.

In the next section,
I will discuss ways to export your work to a
word processor program and how to edit your Wikipedia article.
