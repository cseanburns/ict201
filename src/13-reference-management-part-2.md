## Introduction

At this point you should have built up a decent collection
of information sources in your Zotero library for your Wikipedia project.
You may have even been using it for your other courses, too, and
if not, then start!
If you need to collect more sources for your Wikipedia article,
this is the time to do it.
Revisit the previous sections to remind yourself
about the existing sources that exist on the web and at the library,
and to emind yourself how to search those sources.

In the last few weeks of this course,
your final goal is to edit your chosen Wikipedia article
based on the information resources you've collected.

In order to prepare for the Wikipedia edit,
it's time to return to your Zotero collection.
You should have been reading the sources you've collected,
and taking notes on them in Zotero.
Now is a good time to get caught up and add (more) notes
or refine and edit them,
synthesize them,
and begin writing content for your Wikipedia article.

Zotero and other reference managers offer a number of tools
to help with this process.
As a reminder,
you can use your Zotero browser plugin to automatically add
information sources to your Zotero library.
You can store those sources in folders in your Zotero library.
A folder can be project based.
You can also tag each information source for more organization.
You can highlight and add notes to PDF copies in Zotero.

In the next section,
I will discuss ways to export your work to a
word processor program and how to edit your Wikipedia article.

## Integrating with Word Processors

Although our main project this semester is
to edit a Wikipedia article,
in most cases you will want to work on papers
in a word processing program like Microsoft Word,
Google Docs, or [LibreOffice Writer][lowriter].

Zotero is able to work with the above three word processors.
Mendeley and EndNote are primarily geered toward Microsoft Word,
and if you elected to use those two RMs,
then reach out to your instructor,
or search the web,
for guidance on using
these with those Google Docs or LibreOffice Writer,
if you use those, too. 

Using Zotero with Word, Docs, or Writer is straightforward.
The necessary plugins are already installed when you installed
Zotero Desktop, and 
[additional instructions are available, too][zoteroWordProcessors].

You'll want to use Zotero as you write papers, etc.
to insert in-text citations and bibliographies.
While Zotero or other reference managers can handle this automatically,
you should still review your in-text citations and bibliographies
to check for any errors.
If there are errors,
it's likely because the item in Zotero is missing metadata for
some fields (like author, title, journal title, publication date, etc.).
This happens because the source information Zotero extacts
metadata from may be incomplete or malformed.

With Zotero, you can add in-text citations like:
(Smith, 2007) or (Chan, 2018, p. 144) or "Garcia (2020) stated ...".
You can also generate bibliographies using many different styles,
like APA, MLA, Chicago, and so forth.
Zotero will auto-update your bibliography
as you add more in-text citations.
To set a default style, in Zotero,
click on the **Edit** button in the Zotero menu bar,
click on the **Cite** tab, and
then choose your default style,
which will most likely be one of these:

- American Psychological Association 7th edition
- Chicago Manual of Style edition (author-date or full note)
- Modern Language Association 9th edition
- American Medical Association 11th edition

> While the preferences window is open,
> go ahead and click on the **Export** tab, and under **Item Format**,
> select **Wikipedia Citation Templates** from the drop down menu.
> This will come in handy when you edit your Wikipedia article.
